I have always been interseted in tech, it's something in school that always caught my eye. I want to be able to own my own company and I feel there is a lot of ways to make that happen after I finish this course. I been to college and since every class gets more expensive I am hoping this program helps me find a job in the field I'm going to school in and help me proceed my education.
